## Project Overview
In today’s rapidly evolving technological landscape, traditional teaching methods are becoming less efficient in engaging students. Online learning has become more and more prevalent in recent times. Though it has its benefits such as making learning accessible anywhere and everywhere, it also has its pitfalls. A significant pitfall is the potential for student distraction and the reduction of student attention span in an online learning environment as opposed to live teaching where teachers and students are able to closely interact with each other. With these pitfalls in mind, we have developed subject-specific quizzes presented in a gamified format, to make online learning more engaging. We aspire not only to foster interactivity but to instil a sense of enjoyment and enthusiasm for learning, transforming virtual classroom into dynamic spaces of exploration and discovery

## Design Process
From a perspective of being a student in primary and secondary school, even physical classroom environment started to become very monotonous as teachers focused on completing the syllabus and ensuring students were exam ready. There was a lack of enjoyment in classes which in turn led to a lack of motivation to study. Thus, I took this opportunity to address the lack of engagement and creativeness in teaching by developing a gamified subject-specific quiz, where it not only teaches key concepts but also makes classes more fun and engaging, providing the target audience with an enjoyable experience. 

## Target Audience

**Young Children** The target audience are young students aged between 6-12. The rationale behind for choosing this age-group of students is because they belong to a time where technological advancements is at its peak. Hence, they are more exposed to technological advancement in education such as online learning. They are part of a generation who are more tech savvy, which also allows for easy distraction. With the subject-specific quizzes, we are not only able to use their tech savviness to an advantage, we are able to reduce distraction and increase learning. 

## Our Services

### 1. Subject-Specific Quizzes
There are quizzes for different subject mainly English, Math and Science which are the main subjects taught to students aged between 6-12. Each of the subject has a variety of topics. An example would be for the subject English there are topics such as Vocabulary and Grammar. We have developed quizzes for the different topic within each subject. The quizzes we have developed for the English subject are Grammar, Vocabulary and Spelling. The quizzes for the subject of Math are Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication. Finally the quizzes for the Science subject are Magnet, Plants and Living things. The main of aim of having subject specific and topic specific quizzes is to firstly allow students to choose topics they are weak in and develop their knowledge on those topics. Secondly it allows students a wider variety of topics to choose from. 

### 2. Redemption System
Our quizzes have a redemption system which awards students a variety of gifts for their excellent performance in their quizzes. Students are able to gain points called V-Bucks every time they play a quiz. After attaining a certain number of V-Bucks, students are able to redeem points to buy merchandise on the Big Brain website. The merchandise sold on the website are products that students might require such as notebooks, bags, bottles and many more. Through this redemption system, it encourages students to play more quizzes to gain more points and get their desired products, which in turn increases student participation in the quizzes and allows them to learn and get rewarded for their learning efforts.

## Features

1. **User Authentication:**
   - This feature has 2 components. The first component is Login page, which allows users to access their accounts by entering the relevant credentials such as username and password. This will allow for a more personalised experience and also allow users to access privileges that are specifically tailored for users with accounts, such as vbucks. The second component is sign up or registration page, which allows for users to create an account by providing necessary information. This allows for users to enjoy perks reserved for registered users

2. **Ability to choose your desired quizzes:**
   - The correct answers are displayed every time the student gets a question wrong in the quiz. The correct answers are displayed during the quiz itself and not after. This is to allow students to understand the reason they got the question on the spot rather than wait till the end of the quiz. This will help students why they went wrong and learn from their mistakes. . 

3. **Timer**
   - There is a specific time-frame allowed to answer each question in the quiz. Students are given a 15-second time-frame to answer each question. This timer feature sets an exam-like environment for students, allowing them to think and answer on the spot. Due to the exam-like environment, it makes students to be better prepared exams due to their timed practice when completing the quizzes. 
4. **Result Page**
   - The result page displays the final score attained by the student after the completion of a quiz. Depending on the result, there are motivational quotes. Say for example if a student access the quiz, it says ¬¬¬awesome job, and if a student fails or does not perform well in a quiz it displays better luck next time message. This is to personalize the interaction between students and quiz and give them motivation to do better. 

5. **Leader-board**
   - The leader-board is table where students are able to view both their and other students’ scores. They are able to compare their results with other students who have completed the same quiz. This is to say if a student completes a Grammar quiz, they are able to compare their scores with other students who have also completed the Grammar quiz. The students are able to sort by name, quiz and score. This promotes healthy competition among students, and allows them to retake the quiz in the event they did not perform and get a decent score to increase their rank in the leader-board. 
6. **Search Bar**
   -The search bar allows for easy navigation and allows students to search for their desired quizzes without a hassle due to responsive drop down options.

Students will earn higher V-Bucks should they ace their quiz or top in the leader-board. With the V-Bucks attained they are able to redeem the points to get their desired merchandise. Each merchandise has a specific points allocated to them and students are only able to get those merchandise if they have sufficient points. For example a notebook is 600 V Bucks, if students have 600 V Bucks they are able to redeem their points to get the notebook. This serves as a reward system where students can take quizzes to get more points to get the desired product.

## Technology Used

- **HTML (Hyper MarkUp Language):** HTML serves as the foundational language for structuring the diverse content of a web page. It is used a building block for web development to cocreate a hierarchy. and relationships between elements. Tags such as h1, img, form, and section serve as the backbone, enabling the creation of distinct features on the website.
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** A style sheet is a collection of rules that tells a web browser how to display a document written in HTML It helps to specify styles for elements, including colors, fonts, positioning. CSS plays a crucial role in enhancing the visual appearance and user experience of a website.
- **JavaScript:**
  1. **Form Validation:** Helps to validate user inputs in sign-in and contact forms. This ensures that data collected are valid and meets the necessary requirements. Thus, enhancing the data accuracy and security 
  2. **Dynamic Popup/Content Selection:** Help to display the specific quizes of the chosen subject categories. This allows for a personalized and efficient browsing experience, tailoring content to user preferences. 
  3. **Transition Effects:** Seamless and engaging user interface is created through JavaScript, where it allows for smooth transition between sign-in and sign-out states.
  4. **Loading and validation of quiz:** JavaScript is essential to several parts of our quiz feature. First of all, it makes quiz questions easier to dynamically load and display. We can write methods in JavaScript that retrieve quiz data from a JSON file or a RESTful API such as restdb, parse the information, and then add questions and response options to the quiz interface. JavaScript also allows us to create logic for answer validation. When a user selects a response, JavaScript functions can instantly inform them of the accuracy of their response by comparing their selection with the proper response. This instantaneous feedback promotes learning and makes the quiz more interactive.
  5. **Session Storage:** Session storage, a feature provided by JavaScript, allows us to store temporary data on the client side. We can utilize session storage to store information such as the user's current progress in the quiz, selected answers, or scores. This data persistence across different pages enables seamless navigation within the quiz interface and ensures that users can continue their quiz session even if they switch between pages or refresh the browser.
- **JSON:** Because JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is used to exchange and store data, it is perfect for organizing quiz questions and answers into a machine-and human-readable format. We can easily arrange the quiz's information, including the question prompts, answer options, and right answers, using JSON.
- **RESTDB:** Programmatically interacting with a database is made possible via RESTful APIs like restdb, which facilitate easy retrieval and manipulation of data. We may utilize restdb to store and manage the quiz data, which includes questions, answers, and scoring details, in the context of our quiz functionality. This makes it possible for the quiz content to be easily scaled and updated dynamically.
- **Bootstrap:** The well-known front-end framework Bootstrap offers pre-made elements and styling choices that expedite the development process and guarantee a uniform user experience across various browsers and devices. Using Bootstrap, we can make aesthetically pleasing quiz interfaces with movable buttons, sliders, and layout frameworks that improve the quiz's overall visual appeal and usefulness
- **Slider JS:** Slider.js is a JavaScript package that enhances the functionality of our quiz feature by enabling the creation of sliders and interactive features. We can create dynamic sliders with Slider.js to allow viewers to interact with the quiz information in an easy and entertaining way as they navigate through the questions. This improves the user experience and motivates engagement, which makes the learning environment more fun and productive.
